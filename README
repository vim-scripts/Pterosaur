Pterosaur is a Vim/Pentadactyl extension that gives you the full power of Vim in each Firefox text field.

Pterosaur is pretty awesome, but this is an alpha release. It still has bugs. You have been warned.

Pterosaur requires eventloop.vim. (https://github.com/ardagnir/eventloop.vim)

See https://github.com/ardagnir/pterosaur for more information.
