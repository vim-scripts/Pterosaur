Pterosaur
=========

Pterosaur is a Pentadactyl/Vim extension that gives you the full power of Vim in each Firefox text field.

![Demo](/pterosaur_demo.gif?raw=true)


##Requirements
- Pterosaur requires Pentadactyl and Vim(your version needs to have +clientserver).
- Pterosaur requires [eventloop.vim](https://github.com/ardagnir/eventloop.vim)
- Pterosaur assumes you are using Linux. It might work on OS X.

##Setup
**Step 1:** Install pterosaur and eventloop.vim using your Vim plugin-manager. For pathogen-compatible managers:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone http://github.com/ardagnir/eventloop.vim
    git clone http://github.com/ardagnir/pterosaur
    
**Step 2:** Add pterosaur.js to ~/.pentadactyl/plugins/

    mkdir ~/.pentadactyl/plugins
    cd ~/.pentadactyl/plugins
    ln -s ~/.vim/bundle/pterosaur/pterosaur.js pterosaur.js

**Step 3:** Pterosaur's full-vim editing is disabled by default. Type `:set fullvim` in firefox to enable it.

##How it works
Pterosaur runs an actual vim instance in the background and routes keystrokes through vim.

##Bugs
( If you find a bug that isn't listed here, please create a github issue. )

- Some editors (like github outside of zen-mode) do weird things with text that make text manipulation difficult and mess up pterosaur. I still need to find a good solution for this. 
- Pterosaur's modeline isn't accurate in visual or selection mode.

##Notes
- Pterosaur attempts to be unobtrusive, so even though it edits every non-password textbox with vim, it starts out in vim's insert mode and enters vim's select mode when you select text with the mouse. This allows you to use traditional firefox mouse behavior, while still being able to leave insert mode and use anything you want from vim.

##Troubleshooting
- If you can't enter text in fullvim mode, type `vim --serverlist` in your commandline. You should see a server strting with `PTEROSAUR_`. If you don't, you probably don't have support for vim servers (check `vim --version | grep server`) or pterosaur doesn't think firefox is running. If you do see it, either pterosaur isn't able to communicate with vim, or you're using a text-field that can't handle pterosaur (most search engines, including duckduckgo, start-page, and google search CAN handle pterosaur, so they make good tests).
- If `:set usevim` doesn't even work in pentadactyl, there's a problem on the pentadactyl side. Type `:messages` in pentadactyl and it should tell you the error.
