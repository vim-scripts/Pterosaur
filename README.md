Pterosaur
=========

Pterosaur is a Pentadactyl/Vim extension that gives you the full power of Vim in each Firefox text field.

![Demo](/pterosaur_demo.gif?raw=true)

Pterosaur is at more of an alpha/proof-of-concept stage right now, but it's already somewhat useful.


##Requirements
- Pterosaur requires Pentadactyl and Vim(your version needs to have +clientserver).
- Pterosaur assumes you are using Linux. It might work on OS X.

##Setup
**Step 1:** Install pterosaur using your Vim plugin-manager. For pathogen-compatible managers:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone http://github.com/ardagnir/pterosaur
    
**Step 2:** Add pterosaur.js to ~/.pentadactyl/plugins/

    mkdir ~/.pentadactyl/plugins
    cd ~/.pentadactyl/plugins
    ln -s ~/.vim/bundle/pterosaur.js pterosaur.js

**Step 3:** Pterosaur's full-vim editing is disabled by default. Type `:set fullvim` in firefox to enable it.

**Step 4:** Your default vim setup will need a mapping to get out of vim's insert mode, since \<ESC\> is handled by pentadactyl (and currently broken).
If you haven't set up something like `inoremap kj <ESC>`, you might want to consider it. This mappping alone will change your life.

##How it works
Pterosaur runs an actual vim instance in the background and routes keystrokes through vim.

##Bugs
- Escape leaves textboxes while in insert mode, but does nothing in normal mode.
- Some editors (like github outside of zen-mode) do weird things with text that make text manipulation difficult. Usually, pterosaur will fail into normal(vimless) text entry, but for some types of weirdness it will completly refuse to enter text at all.
- If you map another key to /, :, or ? in vim's normal mode, pterosaur won't show you the ex command you are typing until you hit enter.
- The code to handle multiple windows is hacky. If you create multiple windows at the same time, pterosaur might break and lose some of your keys.
- Mouse support is limited. Currently, you can click anywhere in a textbox to move the cursor there in insert mode. Eventually, mouse selection will be supported as well.

##Troubleshooting
- If you can't enter text in fullvim mode, type `vim --serverlist` in your commandline. You should see a `PTEROSAUR` server. If you don't, you probably don't have support for vim servers (check `vim --version | grep server`) or pterosaur doesn't think firefox is running. If you do see it, either pterosaur isn't able to communicate with vim, or you're using a text-field that can't handle pterosaur (most search engines, including duckduckgo, start-page, and google search CAN handle pterosaur, so they make good tests).
- If `:set usevim` doesn't even work in pentadactyl, there's a problem on the pentadactyl side. Type `:messages` in pentadactyl and it should tell you the error.
